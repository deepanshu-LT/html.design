Q: How can I best care for my new clothing to maintain its quality? <br>
A: Proper care ensures longevity for your favorite pieces. For most of our clothing items, we recommend following the care instructions on the label. Typically, a gentle machine wash in cold water and air drying or tumble drying on low heat helps maintain the fabric's quality. Avoiding harsh chemicals and bleaches also extends the life of your garments.
